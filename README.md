# Self Driving Car
The project has been realized in order to familiarize with the concept of Reinforcement Learning, DeepQLearing and pytorch.

### Code

* `ai.py` - This is code for defining the DeepQLearing model that will operate in the enviroment.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `SelfDrivingCar/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following command:

`python3 map.py`
